#Overview: 

PH recently hired a new data analyst, Bobby, to model, engineer, and analyze which employees will be eligible for retirement and which jobs will need to be back-filled.  Bobby’s employer used Excel and VBA in the past for data wrangling, but with him coming onboard, he has the freedom to implement SQL to generate a list of employees who are eligible fore retirement.

#Results:

  - Of the 90,398 people eligible for retirement, over 80% of PH employees are in Engineering roles while only two people are in Managerial roles.
  - There are 1,549 PH employees who are eligible for mentorship.
  - There’s a significant gap between the number of retiring engineering personnel and the number of PH employees who are eligible to backfill retiree spots.
  - PH is in a very risky position relative to how prepared it is for the ’silver tsunami.'

#Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

  - PH will need to fill 88,839 roles as a results of “silver tsunami.” 
  - Luckily, the ratio of mentors to mentees suits PH well for developing the next rung of staff.
  - PH also might find it beneficial to gather information about retirement-eligible employees who may continue working on a part-time basis as well as       
    investigating a way to refer or recruit Engineering professionals into the company.
